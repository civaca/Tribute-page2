                <h2> When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, 
                    I certainly didn't plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, 
                    or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.

                    <figcaption id="img-caption"> Sir Alexander Fleming FRS FRSE FRCS was a Scottish biologist,
                        pharmacologist and botanist. 
                        His best-known discoveries are the enzyme lysozyme in 1923 and the world's first antibiotic 
                        substance benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) from the mould Penicillium notatum in 1928, for 
                        which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst
                        Boris Chain. He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy.
                        Fleming was knighted for his scientific achievements in 1944.[6] In 1999, he was named 
                        in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century. In 2002,
                        he was chosen in the BBC's television poll for determining the 100 Greatest Britons, 
                        and in 2009, he was also voted third "greatest Scot" in an opinion poll conducted by STV, 
                        behind only Robert Burns and William Wallace</figcaption>
